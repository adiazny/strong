Then use 70% of your 8-rep max for the following sets of 2Ã—8-10. \n\nMake sure you work up in weights similar to how I described warming up for your work sets and work all the way up to an 8 rep max (RM) (the most you can do with good form).\n\nThen for the next 2 sets of 8-10, I want you to drop the weight down by 30% and finish your 2 sets with this weight.\n\nSo, if you do 225lbs for your top set of 8, dropping that to 70% of your 8RM means your 2nd and 3rd set will be about ~160lbs.\n\nOver time, if you can get more than 10 reps on your 2nd and 3rd set with this figure, drop it to 80% instead of 70%.","",
